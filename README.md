The CodeOnion project started with the idea of how to alleviate the hassle of repetitive coding tasks and reduce the time spent on initial code work. This library encapsulates code in functionally atomic units or at least minimal units, storing them for quick and easy generation by the user through the CLI (Command Line Interface). Furthermore, it is planned with the intention of continuously improving the quality of the code and developing the library through open-source operations and community contributions.

- **Minimize Repetitive Code Tasks**: Reduces repetitive tasks that developers often encounter, saving time and effort.
- **Atomic Code Encapsulation**: Efficiently manages code separated by each function, allowing for quick and selective application of the needed features.
- **Reduce Initial Project Setup Costs**: Quickly configures the basic settings needed when starting a new project, reducing waste of time and resources in the early stages of the project.
- **Continuous Improvement through Open Source**: The quality and efficiency of the code can be continuously improved through diverse contributions from the open-source community.
